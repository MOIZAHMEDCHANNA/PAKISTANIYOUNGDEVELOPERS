            <br>
            <p class="par">I am Moiz Ahmed and I am 13 years old. I have been studying in The City School. Here I found out for the first time that I am good at coding. But I have found out that there are many students in the world who have this ability hidden inside them but there is no one tounscrew these students and take this ability out of them. My vision while making this site was to provide these students knowledge about computers and coding. his is my first HTML website and I hope you liked it. In future Insha Allah I will work more on this vision and also make websites on Python, C++ and Javascript etc.<br>
