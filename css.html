        CSS stands for C ascading S tyle S heets and is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page, It also includes user interfaces such as hover, clicking and scrolling. CSS is a simple language which is easy to learn but the grammar of this language is very important and has to be correct. Minor changes in code can lead to disasters!!<br>

            <h2>CSS SOLVED A BIG PROBLEM</h2><br>         
            HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!<br>
            HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:<br>
            < h1>This is a heading</ h1><br>
            < p>This is a paragraph.< /p><br>
            When tags like < font>, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.<br>
            To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.<br>
            CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!<br>

        </p>
        <h2>CSS SYNTAX</h2><br>
        <img src="ar.jpg" width="450" height="100"> <br>
        <p class="par">
            The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.<br>

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.<br>

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.<br>

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.<br>
    </div>
<h3>FOR EXAMPLE:</h3><br>
<img src="h.png" width="700" height="200"> <br>
<div class="content3">
    <p class="par">
        1. p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: < p>).<br>
2. color is a property, and red is the property value<br>
3. text-align is a property, and center is the property value<br>

<h4>INSERTING CSS:</h4>
Three Ways to Insert CSS<br>
There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:<br>

1. External CSS<br>
2. Internal CSS<br>
3. Inline CSS<br>
<br>
<br>
<h5>1. External CSS</h5>
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!<br>

Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the < link> element, inside the head section.<br>
<img src="w.png" width="700" height="400"> <br>
<br>
<br>
An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.<br>

The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h6>Internal CSS</h6>
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.<br>
<br>
The internal style is defined inside the < style> element, inside the head section.<br>
<br>
<img src="q.png" width="700" height="400"> <br>
<br>
<h1>Inline CSS</h1>
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.

To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.

Tip: An inline style loses many of the advantages of a style sheet (by mixing content with presentation). Use this method sparingly.
